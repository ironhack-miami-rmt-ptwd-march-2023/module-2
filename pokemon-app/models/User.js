    // and you also know the function that was used to scramble it,
    // you still cant unscramble it, even when the user logs in,
    // the app does not unscramble the stored hashedPassword and compare to the password the user types in
    // instead, the app scrambles whatever the user types in, in the same way that the password was scrambled
    //  so these hash functions are sometimes called a one way hash
